# BookSwap

BookSwap is a Flutter mobile app (also targets desktop & web) that lets students post textbook listings, initiate swap offers, and chat — backed by Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, FCM).

## Quick overview
- Entry point: `lib/main.dart`  
- Firebase options: `lib/firebase_options.dart` (generated by FlutterFire CLI)  
- State management: Provider (providers live in `lib/providers/`)  
- Services: Firestore and Storage wrappers in `lib/services/`  
- Models: `lib/models/` (e.g., `book.dart`)  
- Screens: `lib/screens/` (Browse, My Listings, Chats, Settings, Auth flows)

## Key features implemented
- Email/password authentication with Firebase Auth (includes email verification flows).  
- CRUD for book listings (title, author, condition, cover image — image upload uses Firebase Storage).  
- Swap offers: create a pending swap, syncs in real-time via Firestore.  
- Basic chat scaffold (messages saved in Firestore subcollections).  
- Settings screen with simulated notification toggles (can be persisted to Firestore & connected to FCM).  
- Bottom navigation with Browse Listings, My Listings, Chats, Settings.

## Project structure (high level)
- android/, ios/, windows/, macos/, linux/, web/ — native platform projects  
- lib/
  - main.dart — app bootstrap + provider wiring
  - models/ — data models
  - providers/ — ChangeNotifiers for auth, listings, swaps, settings
  - services/ — Firestore, Auth, Storage, Messaging helpers
  - screens/ — UI screens and navigation
- test/ — unit and widget tests
- pubspec.yaml — dependencies

## Local setup (summary)
1. Install Flutter and required toolchains (Android Studio, Xcode if iOS).  
2. Configure Firebase:
   - Use Firebase Console to add apps (Android/iOS/web/desktop).
   - Download `google-services.json` → place in `android/app/`.
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` → place in `ios/Runner/`.
   - Or run:
     - `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`
     - ensure `firebase` CLI is installed and logged in (`firebase login`)
     - `flutterfire configure` (generates `lib/firebase_options.dart` and updates native projects)
3. Get packages:
```powershell
flutter pub get
```
4. Run the app on a device/emulator (do not rely on web only for this course):
```powershell
flutter run
```
